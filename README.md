# Crud-ExpressJs
This is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete). 

Created using Typescript, expressJs and Mongoose 

Take a while (4 days exactly) to my first project by myself 

This is just the backend of the project 

Soon I will create the frontend and this happen I will put my project here too

I have one advice to people, who don't fell confidente to create your first project 

"Do, try, search, read, do everything you can. If I can do it, you can too!!!"

To see how this project works it's simple:

- Open your terminal
- Run git clone https://github.com/Sarah-Ribeiro/Crud-ExpressJS-Backend.git
- mkdir Crud-ExpressJS-Backend
- npm i 
- yarn start
- Open localhost:3001 and try by yourself!!!
